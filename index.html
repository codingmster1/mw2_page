<p>The reveal trailer provided our first look at 
    Modern Warfare 2's campaign in action. We see members of Task Force 141 carrying out a range 
    of operations around the world.From intense action-driven moments to the more stealth-based 
    night missions we've seen in previous entries, a wide variety of combat opportunities were 
    present in the trailer.
